## Lyrics

```
black, black code execute (is on the move?)
black, black code execute

i stay in the darkness of the dead
my eyes just keep glowing red blood red
plugged into vastness of the net
i sense theyâ€™re coming to an end

black code execution, all i do these days
weave grim dark spells into destitute
passing through the network belts 
as i let em recoup, losses from the 
mainnet trackers, droppin into fearless urge

sifting through zero 
one zero one one

black code, black hat in a hex
dark ops mode is on (on the node)
there are devils in my process 
keeping me from threats

serpents, the cables are a path to a world
all i purge is my node 
i turn into remote revenant
as i write my black code
try to make it work



```
